This is a responsive website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A game database API was used for this site. I used JavaScript Fetch API to get the data from the API site.
This site was built for practice purposes. A lot more functions could be added to the site. However, this project is focusing on the usage of third-party API 
and how to make it interact with the user interface.
